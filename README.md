# Notice!
DNSCrypt support is deprecated in favor of GeoHideDNS:

1. Install [bindhosts](https://github.com/bindhosts/bindhosts), I recommend using mode 10 for KernelSU. (it's compatible with SuSFS v2)
2. Install [AdAway](https://f-droid.org/ru/packages/org.adaway/), give root rights.
3. Add this [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Internet-Helper/GeoHideDNS/refs/heads/main/hosts/hosts) to access restricted content.
